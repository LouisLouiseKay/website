  **Resonate’s Community Credentials** project helps communities to award simple badge-like credentials that can be proven and recognised across organisations.

  We will assure safety, confirm identity and protect all data and private information.
details: "[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/) are a new web standard for proving things digitally, thanks to some clever cryptography.  We are building Community Credentials to be the ‘Know Your Co-operator’ equivalent of KYC (Know Your Customer for business) for co-op social trust, all without reliance on centralised providers (or blockchains)."
