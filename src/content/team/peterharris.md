Active as a web developer since the 90s, Peter has built hundreds of sites across dozens of industries. He has focused especially on the music industry, collaborating with numerous musicians, from struggling artists to mid-level bands (and even a few platinum-selling superstars). Working by day as a web dev, Peter had a night hobby as a DJ and electronica producer. This led to experiments with virtually every web and music publishing platform available. Exploring all of their weaknesses and strengths, this combination of background and insight eventually birthed Resonateâ€™s fundamental features. Beyond Resonate, Peter is actively contributing to groups and initiatives seeking to create a blockchain-based standard for music metadata and licensing. He has spoken at the following festivals and conferences about Resonate and the blockchain: re:publica, Sonar+D, Reeperbahn, Music Tech Fest, Elevate, Most Wanted Music, Reworks, Supermarkt, Platform Cooperativism, Pop Kultur and From Me 2 U.
