As the owner of an independent record label, Luke is very aware of the ways in which the music industry fails artists. He’s also a long-term NTS radio DJ, and strongly values community, independence and culture. Luke originally comes from London, but recently relocated to Berlin to work for Resonate as Head of Marketing. He’s highly driven to help build an equitable platform that all independent artists can share in and benefit from. You can find him on Twitter: @blackwax_cr
