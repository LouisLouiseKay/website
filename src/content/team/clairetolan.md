Trained as a writer and archivist, Claire Tolan learned to program somewhere between the Yosemite National Park archives, the University of Michigan School of Information, and the Tactical Technology Collective in Berlin. She has built websites and software for NGOs, universities and start-ups, and has been a decentralization advocate since registering her first diaspora* account in 2012, which (weirdly) provided her with the opportunity to move to Berlin. Since 2014, she has hosted "You're Worth It," the ASMR show on Berlin Community Radio. At present, she is making chimes, designing a table-top role-playing game, and cataloging lichen in the forests surrounding Berlin.
