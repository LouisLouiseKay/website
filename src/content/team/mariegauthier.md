Marie found out about Resonate during the Music Tech Fest taking place at Berlin's Funkhaus in May 2016, where the co-op took part in the #MTFLabs: Blockchain event. As a creative web developer, music lover and maker, she believes in the better economic and social model for music streaming that Resonate enables.
