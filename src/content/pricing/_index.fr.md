  p1: "Our unique stream2own system splits the cost across 9 plays that start very low (a fifth of a penny) and increase each time that track is played. If Listeners love a track, they have the option to pay the full price (about 1.25 €) or “buy now”."
  p2: "To support exploration of new music, Resonate guarantees artists a minimum earning of One Cent per Play while keeping the price so low Listeners can stream dozens of tracks for the first time for pennies (about 4 cents an hour in most cases). This way, listeners start as explorers and become backers."

        Of that, musicians/rights holders get 70% with 30% going to pay for the platform and writer royalties. Resonate pays artists/rights holders out as soon as they’ve earnt 10€ on the platform.

        Stream2own makes for a better relationship between listeners and artists, where they can find representative reward from those who value their music and build a trusted relationship with listeners who will be their advocates.

        With subscription streaming, artists are forced into a new form of digital servitude as listeners would have to stream a song hundreds of times to equal the price of a single download.    

        To listen, you just buy credit (5, 10, 20€) and stream or buy now.

        Our members, who are are artists and listeners, and our owners, are currently discussing future plans and ideas for new ways to pay, listen and enjoy art on Resonate. Including pay what you want, direct fan support for artists, collective and high streamer subscription offers. Watch this space and contribute your ideas via the topic in the [forum](https://community.resonate.is).

        To do this, Resonate is testing a kind of decentralized membership or ‘Community Credentials’ that allows co-op memberships, special purchases and simple agreements between Members to be validated without exposing the private data of the people involved. 

        A system like this could allow members of one co-op or service to be recognized by others without personal information being exposed or stored in centralized databases.

      details: |-
        We imagine a future with many life supporting services provided by different co-ops sharing this kind of safe authentication. 

        For example, an artist might earn credit when their song plays in a co-op coffee shop. Then they could exchange their music earnings as credits for food at a co-op store, or rehearsal space at a land trust, or other services at a time bank in their neighborhood. 

        By connecting co-ops together in this way, more and more people might have the opportunity to use spaces and services that are democratically-owned and managed. We might begin to inhabit a completely ‘co-operative lifestyle’ without the online tracking and data profiling common today.
