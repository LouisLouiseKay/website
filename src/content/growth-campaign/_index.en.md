paragraphs_1:
  - paragraph: "<span class='ba pa1'>For listeners</span> Resonate involves owning something of real value in a digital economy. It’s also about a shift away from ‘passive’ consumption, towards a new mode of discovering and engaging."
  - paragraph: "<span class='ba pa1'>For artists</span> this means owning their work, and owning their networks. Resonate is about fairness and control; we allow creators to set the terms on which to distribute their art."
  - paragraph: "<span class='ba pa1'>For industry</span> we are rewiring terms of business, transforming an industry that’s currently based on exclusivity and inequity into one based on openness, transparency, and collaboration."
  - paragraph: "<span class='ba pa1'>For everyone</span> this is about co-owning a platform. We think that this one-member, one-vote system gives everyone a voice, and supports the community in a crucial way."
paragraphs_2:
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>STREAMING services wield too much power over discovery, and “big pool” methods of splitting royalties are unfair. Music has been turned into content, and fans into passive listeners."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>INEQUITIES have been exacerbated. Power has been consolidated not in the hands of creators, but in those of dominant tech companies and major labels."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>INEFFICIENCIES plague the music industry and often lead to slow, inaccurate royalty payouts and expensive legal disputes."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>PRIVACY is surrendered for free content; targeted ad revenues demand ever more discolsure of personal, correlatable information, held centrally."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>TRANSPARENCY is lost when algorithms steer music discovery and artists are asked to pay to promote their work amongst a tide of music written to maximise streaming revenue."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>CONNECTIONS between artists and listeners are weakened and a sense of community is lost when artists have no say in how their music is distributed and listners are no more than platform users, harvested for revenue generation."

    paragraph: "THE CO-OPERATIVE model was first brought to music streaming by Resonate in 2016. A one-member, one-share, one-vote system brings democracy to the platform, and gives all members a voice."
  - icon: "stream2own"
    paragraph: "STREAM2OWN is a fairer way to pay for listening. The more you play, the more you pay, until you have paid to own.  If you love that track, then just buy now in one go.  Artists get paid per play, and fans own music again."
  - icon: "fingerprint"
    paragraph: "SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY puts control of personal information back in the hands of users and away from the trackers. Choose what data you share with whom, peer to peer; verify your credential information without using third parties like Facebook or Google <NEW>"

    paragraph: "OPEN-SOURCE fits naturally with our ethos of openness, collaboration and transparency. We’ll work with anyone so long as they share our values."
  - icon: "community"
    paragraph: "COMMUNITY - A global community of co-creation - Artists, DJ's and Curators, Listeners and Staff - working together to build a special place for the humanity and collectiveness of music experience, totally inclusive, beyond borders, class, race, religion, politics or gender."

    paragraph: "ETHICS come first. We’re considering the impact of everything that we do, from ensuring our operation is environmentally-friendly to the fight against the exclusion and divisive colonialism of mega-streaming"

Resonate began in late 2015 with some ideas from our founder, Peter Harris, an artist-DJ and developer who thought something ought to be done to resist the tide  of commiditisation in music streaming and the growing power of the mega-streaming platforms.

With an experimental platform in place by 2016, and lots of encouraging support from the music community and the press, Peter and his growing founders team established Resonate as a multi-stakeholder co-operative, based in Ireland, in 2016.  Music community and the co-operative business model seemed a good fit: artists and listeners own the platform - cut out the middleman!  Many agreed: a successful crowdfunding campaign brought the first wave of new members and supporters.

The service went live in 2017 amidst a wave of excitement around a booming crypto economy, wildly successful initial coin offerings and platforms based on blockchain technology.  It seemed a great opportunity to exploit potential economic and technological benefits of a new platform. In 2018 new funds and lots of work began on the new platform.  Sadly the blockchain platform did not materialise, and amidst a crypto-winter of 2018-9 Resonate reverted successfully to ethically-sourced cloud platforms and became an open-source community project.

Resonate may now be on centralised technology, but it thinks and acts decentralised - democratically, and always open and transparent. Most of our work since 2018 has been done on a volunteer basis. Our lovely clean new beta player came out in 2019 and works beautifully on the desktop and mobile. We continued to build up a great catalogue of nearly 2000 artists who between them have contributed 13000 tracks of extraordinarily fresh and creative music of all genres to our catalogue, some coming to us direct, others via their labels and distributors.

Since 2019 we have struggled to grow our listener base because our volunteer resources are stretched and part-time.  Without much promotion of the service we have been in our own sort of lockdown, but now we think it's the time to come out with a strong vision, a new team and commitment to reviving our community.  We need funding to do that, so we are renewing our established Supporter Share campaign (and donations of course!) to help put us back on track to scale as a global platform co-op.

We have detailed plans for some exciting privacy-enhancing and decentralised community features and with these we have won EU Next Generation Internet grant competitions.  That's a government grade endorsement of our vision, impact and the strength of our team.  (You can more about our Projects and our Roadmap on our main website.)  However, we still need to match-fund these grants with supporter funding.  We can't hope to do all the work on a purely volunteer basis.
