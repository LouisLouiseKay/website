paragraphs_2:
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>STREAMING services wield too much power over discovery, and “big pool” methods of splitting royalties are unfair. Music has been turned into content, and fans into passive listeners."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>INEQUITIES have been exacerbated. Power has been consolidated not in the hands of creators, but in those of dominant tech companies and major labels."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>INEFFICIENCIES plague the music industry and often lead to slow, inaccurate royalty payouts."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>PRIVACY is sorely lacking; fans often need to surrender personal information to stay informed."
  - paragraph: "<span class='f1 dib v-top pl0' style='line-height: 0.9rem'>&bull;</span>CONTROL is needed by all. Artists should have a say in how their music is distributed, listeners should have control over how their data is used."
