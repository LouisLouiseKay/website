    **Listeners can earn co-op membership by contributing 5€ annually.**

    Artist accounts on Resonate are free. Artist co-op membership is earned when you add music to the catalog, and ratify your membership. (If you have music on Resonate, you are eligible for full free co-op membership – this extends to each individual band member, guest vocalists, session musicians etc.)

    All members receive the following benefits:
    - Community – Access to members forum
    - Governance – Vote in all co-op elections
    - Representation – Members and volunteer meet ups
    - Rewards – Share in the profits and success

    We believe the “one member, one share, one vote” system is democratic, and supports community in a crucial way. Resonate is a co-op because we think that everyone should have the opportunity to own their platform. Everyone involved in the co-op has a say in how platform develops.

active_membership:
  title: "Active Membership"
  text: |-
    To maintain an active co-op membership you need to be engaged with the community.

    The heart of the co-op is the Resonate community forum. We also have an open community meeting [every Wednesday](https://community.resonate.is/upcoming-events).

    Artists have to upload a minimum of 1 track year to maintain active co-op membership.
profits:
  title: "Profits"
  text: |-
    Resonate will share any and all profits with consumers (listeners) and workers (musicians, labels, staff and volunteer contributors).

    Members will be able to trade their profits for more streams and downloads and/or withdraw as cash.

    It’s important to note that co-ops are incentivized to declare profits because they validate the business model.

  subtitle: "Resonate is a multi-stakeholder cooperative composed of three different roles: musicians, fans and the people who build it."
  text: "Here’s how profit distributions break down:"
  details: |-
    **Within these groups, profits will be distributed according to involvement**, and not on status, access or other forms of privilege.

    Profit distributions are calculated after first removing 30% from the total. 

    20% is saved for a rainy day fund (a standard procedure for co-ops). If the emergency funds are never used, they’ll simply feed back into the next year's profit declarations.

    The remaining 10% will pay interest for owners of Supporter Shares.

  title: "The Future"
  subtitle: "We imagine a world where all interactions and services are provided by democratic organisations and co-ops. Our aim is to build a corner stone of this eco-system."
  text: |-
    Building a worldwide network of co-operatives is an essential part of rejecting the destructive power of Capitalism and Colonialism within all our societies, working together towards a world built on justice, fairness and equality of the commons.

    A vital part of our vision is the [Community Credentials](/community-credentials) project which will enable cooperatives and creatives to partner, exchange, sell, collaborate, engage and sustain relationships with trust and privacy. 

    The Resonate co-op intends to develop it’s offering in the future beyond music, to incorporate many different collective types of creativity into the the platform in sustainable and positive ways for the community at large.
