Aleksandar is a guy that wears glasses (but not necessarily geeky ones). He's a classical philologist with lots of printing ink on his hands, as well as a promising amateur photographer without a single printed photograph. Aleks is the proud owner of a CHAO 700, the first modular DIY synth in his neighborhood. He's a returning tourist and weekend adventurer in the sphere of electronic music â€“ Master Clock, Knight of the Kick Drum and Knight of the Hi-hats.
