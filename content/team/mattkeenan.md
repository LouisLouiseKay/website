Matt has been writing code since the tender age of 11, and first ventured onto the Internet (ARPANET back then) in '77. He has worked in start ups for more than 20 years with roles from lead developer to CTO. He has done DevOps and systems networking, and has even been known to occasionally do technology lobbying. In his younger days, Matt participated in various choirs, and also studied the piano. His music tastes are wide and eclectic, varying from classical to trance, and from indie pop to krautrock.
