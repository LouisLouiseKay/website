Darryl Neudorf has spent the last 35 years in the music industry. Starting off as musician, composer and performer for the Canadian post-punk band 54/40, he then branched out to engineering, producing, and mixing. Recordings that Darryl has been a part of have reached Gold and Platinum status in Canada and the US, top ten on Billboard, earned Grammy nominations and a Juno award, and a Juno nomination for Engineer of the Year.

Throughout this time, Darrylâ€™s passion as an advocate for artists, combined with an interest in computers and the internet, led him to explore blockchain technology. When researching existing open source social networks in early 2015, Darryl discovered Greg Meredith and his open social network initiative Synereo, and followed it through the transition to RChain.

It was during an event in which Imogen Heap first announced the Mycelia project that Darryl first met Peter and was introduced to Resonate. He is now happy to have joined Resonate and feels privileged to be part of the team!
