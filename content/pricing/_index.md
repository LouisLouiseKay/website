<p class="f4 lh-copy">Our brand new <strong>Stream2own</strong> model splits the cost of a digital download into 9 plays.</p>

Plays start off cheap when you’re discovering and as you fall in love with a song, you come to pay the full price.

There’s no transition out of Resonate to buy a song or album. Purchase it directly, or just keep listening.

Resonate pays artists directly and per-play. For listeners, the overall cost is similar to that of the average monthly streaming subscription.
